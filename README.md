# BaseWebAppAid
Very simple webapp base using Deno. Languages: JS, HTML, CSS 

## Starters

Download Visual Studio Code from here: https://code.visualstudio.com/ and then Deno from here: https://deno.com/ . You may also need .NET framework from here: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework .


Using youtube tutorials, googling and generally trying to learn how to fix and solve issues will be a part of developing your own applications, so this part can also be taken as a part of that journey, "I will, and I can figure these issues myself" is a really good attitude to have, asking questions and wanting assistance and quidance is not bad thing and generally speaking will get you answers rapidly and you will get things moving again. This webapplication base has been created with learning in mind, and I encourage going out and seeking the answers yourself on your own time, and when answers are not coming to you, explain the issue to your cat, rubber ducky or favourite plushie. It really helps.
